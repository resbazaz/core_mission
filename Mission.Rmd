We foster an active and collaborative data science community by hosting weekly and a large annual event that promotes the available data science resources in the broader University of Arizona/Tucson/Arizona community. Through a network of volunteers, we develop opportunities to expand data science to a broader range of disciplines by breaking the stereotype that only developers/computer scientists do data science. We focus on anyone who utilizes or wants to utilize data science techniques from small to large scale.
